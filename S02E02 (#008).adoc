== Tips on working from home from the hosts:

=== When working, do the work

* Allocate a dedicated space. Work only from there. Only work from there.
* Do a morning routine: put your pants on.
* Make sure your family knows you are working.
* Do not get disrtucted to do home chores during working hours (whatever you decide they are).
* Beware of snacks and snacking

=== Don't forget to stop working

* Take a walk.
* Exercise.
* Mute working notifications (except of critical channels) after clocking out.
* Don't be tempted to keep working or checking in on emails and slack.

=== General tips on making it easier

* Don't be embraced asking for help and interrupting people.
* Do more video meetings – body language is important.
* Over-communicate what you've done, what you're doing, what are the problems, and what are your plans, every day.
* Office hours in zoom – open meeting to drop in.
* Use reminders on Slack (for yourself to remind to answer and for others to ping in good hours).
* Rubber duck debugging.
* As a manager - check in on folks, try to create virtual social events.
